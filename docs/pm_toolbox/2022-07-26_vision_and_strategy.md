# Product Culture in internal Data Engineering Teams - Vision

PM Toolbox
{: .label }

##### Published on: 2022-07-26 10:30 Warsaw Time by Piotr Myrcha

In my previous [post](/docs/pm_toolbox/2022-07-19_ost_intro) I shared my views on the OST framework, which helps me keep track of all identified opportunities in our data engineering & analytics team at Allegro Pay. Today however I intend to start from scratch and talk product culture, vision & goals in an internal data engineering team.

Having a strong product culture (or being a strong product culture evangelist) is necessary for most data engineering teams to start perceiving their solutions as internal products. From my experience, most teams position themselves rather as internal services and follow exactly what stakeholders request from them. While this certainly works in many environments, my opinion is that product-oriented culture works better, however is harder to implement and maintain.

In my view it works better (given the necessary freedom & responsibility from the management), because it puts the data team in the management seat of what is the most important thing to build at any given time. Priorities are no longer assessed by the loudness of the stakeholders voices, position in the company etc. - it's the product team that assesses which opportunities to address, how to prioritize and when to pivot. That also gives the team the opportunity to validate assumptions about their users, experiment, measure and draw conclusions from user behaviour. If all goes well, internal data engineering teams should not be building this one solution that took them three quarters to achieve that hardly anyone uses - I think most readers will know of cases like that from personal experience ;)

To achieve a good level of product culture adoption, the entire chain of command has to have the necessary mindset - yes it starts with management, but your individual contributors have to believe that as well. Product managers usually serve as the main evangelists of why this works, but it helps if at least some people at the company are already on board. 

How to change the mindset if most are opposed? In my experience, changing culture is never quick. It is rather a journey of a thousand steps. Personally in such cases I tend to start by identyfing an area where the most freedom for self organization exists (it can be a project, product, cooperation with a certain team etc.) and use that to start setting up the goal (vision is usually a stretch at this point), north star metrics and continuous discovery process for product opportunities. Start interviewing potential users & stakeholders through the lens of our internal product, measure & monitor KPIs often and celebrate every milestone achieved. If this little example works - evangelize the win! But do not stop on the product/project/service you have launched, make sure to let as many stakeholders know that your belief is this was only possible through this little product culture you have started. With a little win like above, it is quite easy to build the domino effect after a while.

Thankfully, most people that were hired as PMs already work in product-driven companies, meaning somebody already did the hard work to introduce product culture beforehand. This is where the actual product work begins - by establishing the vision, goals and strategy.

Yet again, most companies (and quite often teams too) already defined their vision, driving how they strive to change the world. For most data teams (except teams in the actual data solutions industry) in my experience this is usually something down to earth, like "provide all necessary data for the business on time and with quality". It can be more sexy than this, but honestlyâ€¦ it doesn't need to be. It still can drive product-oriented teams to achieve their goals toward such vision.

Most data teams goals and strategy will be very closely tied with ongoing business needs and current data maturity. I find that as long as these needs, priorities and limitations are well known and documented, it is fairly easy to get people on board with a strategy/roadmap of opportunities we would be addressing as a data product team. However, don't assume you will not have to pivot from a strategy if it doesn't play out. Unfortunately as a data team you usually have a dependency on other teams (your users) - if they pivot, you will have to pivot too.

On a more positive note, your strategy doesn't need to be very elaborate to start with - since data eng team is usually an internal service team, business is most interested in the service actually working (data being served when they need it). As long as it is, you can usually have free reign in how you achieve it.

Let's assume we've been successful in setting, negotiating and aligning our goals with the vision of the organization. Next in this series, I will write a bit more about metrics, user personas & interviews and identifying opportunities in a data product team.

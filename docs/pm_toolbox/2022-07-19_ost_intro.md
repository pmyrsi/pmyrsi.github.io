## Introduction to Opportunity Solution Tree's

###### Published on: 2022-07-19 21:30 Warsaw Time

In my day-to-day work I tend not to use a lot of frameworks (I do use a couple subconsciously at this point as we all do) - however Continuous Discovery habit in conjunction with Opportunity Solution Trees (full kudos to Teresa Torres) is somewhat an exception to my rule. My short explanation on OSTs is below, however I strongly encourage any current and aspiring product people to go read Teresa’s book - _Continuous Discovery Habits: Discover Products that Create Customer Value and Business Value_ - it is an eye opener.

I find ProductPlan’s explanation of OST the cleanest - [ProductPlan OST definition](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/opportunity-solution-tree/). It’s a set of visual aids, sort of a plan on how you plan to achieve the goal you are chasing as a product manager. One usually starts from the desired outcome and finds their way down the tree during the continuous discovery process to define all OST tree “nodes” a bit better every time. First by finding out what opportunities/groups of opportunities are present in the current market space, how one might go by trying to address these opportunities (coming up with draft solutions) and then verifying these solutions by experimenting on different assumptions.

An example of an OST (of course it’s not fully populated) from a data PM perspective:

For me this visual framework works, because it is elaborate enough to bring structure to my work (and to the most crucial and most chaotic area for me personally - discovery). It allows me to keep track of what we already know about the users, our assumptions about said users and opportunities as well as experiment outcomes.

As a data PM vast majority of opportunities and solutions are connected with internal initiatives and small requests/snippets of feedback from analysts and other people using data provided by the data engineering team. Without a framework in place to collect & organize this data as well as ability to refer it back to larger goals of the team - it would be very hard if not impossible to not forget something. 

OSTs foster constant experimentation - something quite hard to do in the area of internal data systems, because most users expect the data to be there ready for them and they expect the data structures to be somewhat static. This in turn makes a data PM job a bit more interesting, as we need to find more creative ways to experiment and (in)validate assumptions about our users.

I will delve deeper on the details in the next posts about using OSTs in my day-to-day work as a data PM. Stay tuned for more!

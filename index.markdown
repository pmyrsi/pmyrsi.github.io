# Piotr Myrcha - Product, Tech & Data Blog

## Welcome lovers of product!

Hey world, my name is Piotr Myrcha (you can call me Peter, slavic languages are weird). This blog is my thoughts on various products, services and concepts (usually tech industry-related), 
taken through the lens of a PM and everyday tech-lover.

I'm a mechanical engineer by education, but a product manager and data evangelist by heart, skill and for a couple of years now, also profession. I currently work at Allegro Pay 
(fintech subsidiary of one of the largest European e-marketplaces) as a Data Product Manager. If you want to know what my role at Allegro Pay is, feel free to visit my LI profile below and/or get in touch!

My intention is to share my views on different technology and data related products with the world. All views are my own and in many cases my viewpoint 
is limited to the research performed and/or personal real world usage. If you agree or disagree with any of my points - __good__! I think the world can benefit from more openly shared
opions about products & solutions, especially in a world where sponsored campaigns intertwine very closely with user reviews on social media.
